📝 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance using sales, purchase, and inventory data.
The goal is to help businesses optimize:

Pricing strategies

Inventory turnover

Supplier negotiation

Vendor selection and profitability

🚧 Project Status

🔧 This project is currently in progress.

The following components will be added soon:

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✔ Data cleaning & merging workflows

✔ Aggregated vendor-level dataset

⏳ Power BI dashboard

⏳ Insight summaries & visualizations

📌 Business Problem

Companies often incur losses due to:

Inefficient pricing

Poor inventory turnover

Vendor dependency

Invoice mismatches

High holding costs

Objective of this project:

Identify underperforming vendors

Find top vendors contributing to revenue
